## _University Peer To Peer Teaching Solution_
Bulit Under  "Let's Connect Track" for HackVerse 2.0 
 ##### âœ” Description  of the problem
 We all students have faced the time when we missed one or two classes due to which we are not able to cope-up with what's going on in the class. Moreover these backlogs keeps getting added and when the D-day (exams) comes we find ourselves in a miserable situation where we know the syllabus but we are actuallly wasting most of our valuable watching number of youtube videos to understand a simple topic or calling the freind who promised to teach that topic at the end but not picking up ðŸ˜’.
### âœ”  And Here's the solution for everything stated above 
**UNIV** enables "peer to peeer teaching" which in short means that any student can teach one or many students through  **Google Meet** while being moderated by the institute in exchange of **credits** which  could be redeemed as and when he wants in college campus food stalls or during college fests . Adding to this  a student can create online discussion grps where a number of students can join , discuss topic among themselves or with a teacher and get there doubts clear anytime. Any student can upload his notes  in exchange of credit when a student saves that "Note" . So , all in all this hack enables and motivates the student to help other students :)

### âœ”  So here's how it actually works ðŸ’»:
- The University creates it's account on the **Web App**
- University adds his students manually ( Email and Roll Number )
- Student downloads the App and registers with the Email which is registered with College
- A Student creates a session on a particular date and time from app with a heading and some tags
- Other students who want to know about that topic will join the session at that time ( He will  be reminded if he had registered for the session through message )
- During an active session a moderator can join , check if the session is going well and mark the session as "Completed" on there  **Web App**  after which the session's organizer would get his credits.
- Apart from mentored sessions a student can also create discussion groups where a number of students can join and discuss a topic among themselves ( No Credit for this )
- A Student can add notes on his app and  ask for  credits in exchange.
